Score Keeper Practice

This is a practice project used to keep the score of something. You are also able to reset the score midgame(which will 
automatically reset the values as well. It is also reset if you change the "to score" input. The reset code was refactored as a function in order to shorten the code overall and keep it DRY. Also used the this keyword in the event listeners for practice. Very little CSS for now only used to change the winning score color to green once reached. Will be stylizing the page at a later date with additional CSS.
