Score Keeper Practice

This is a practice project used to keep the score of something. You are also able to change the score midgame(which will 
automatically reset the values as well. It is also reset if you change the "to score" input. The reset code was refactored as a 
function in order to shorten the code overall and keep it DRY. Also used the this keyword in the event listeners for practice.
